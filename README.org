* XT1033 information
** Device Info
- Processor is ARMv7 Processor rev 3 (v7l)
  - Num cores = 4
  - Max Frequency = 1190MHz
  - Instruction sets = armeabi-v7a, armeabi
  - NEON support = Yes
- Device details/specs are [[https://secretspecs.com/model/motorola/motorola-xt1033/][here]]
- GPU is [[https://www.notebookcheck.net/Qualcomm-Adreno-305.110715.0.html][Adreno 305]]
- Chipset is Qualcomm MSM8226 Snapdragon 400
- More specs are [[https://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_moto_g-5831.php][here]]
- StockROM is [[https://motostockrom.com/motorola-moto-g-xt1033][here]]
- User guide is [[https://cdn1.allaboutmotog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/moto-g-manual.pdf][here]]
- It came with Jelly Bean (4.3) but upgradable to Lollipop (5.1.1)
** Getting device info
*** implement sysinfo.sh script
- collects meminfo/cpuinfo/device-properties and others into a log file on the host
- useful particularly to figure out the partitions to be
  - read for creating backup stockROM
  - prepare fstab file while building android from source
*** running the sysinfo.sh script
- Install platform tools inside 'platform-tools' folder in the current dir first
- then run the following command
#+BEGIN_SRC
./sysinfo.sh devinfo-XT1033 /sys/class/power_supply/max17047_battery
cat devinfo-XT1033
#+END_SRC
- Particularly inspect the file 'devinfo' for 'mmcblk' keyword
- look them up in the section of 'df' for their corresponding dir names
- this should also help with figuring out vendor binary locations
- which in turn helps in writing the blobs-extracting script
** Booting to recovery and enabling "fastboot devices"
- Reference [[https://www.hardreset.info/devices/flipkart/flipkart-901-digiflip-pro-xt/recovery-mode/][here]]
  - Hold power button for a brief moment
  - Hold both power and volume-down buttons for 5s
  - As soon as the android robot shows up, release the buttons
- Another approach is to just use adb!
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  adb reboot bootloader
  fastboot devices
  #+END_SRC
** lsusb information
- On cygwin you can install 'usbutils' package to get lsusb working
- lsusb outputs
  - the device is booted and under usb-debugging mode:
    - Bus 001 Device 049: ID 22b8:2e76 Motorola PCS
  - in fastboot mode:
    - Bus 001 Device 044: ID 22b8:2e80 Motorola PCS
** SW build info
- from getprop output, it appears to have been built at build=LPBS23.13-56-2 (ro.build.id)
- this doesn't corresponding to any tags from [[https://source.android.com/setup/start/build-numbers#build][this]] website!
- However, atleast from the first letter, it appears that it is indeed Lollipop
** Kernel source code
- Main repo is: https://github.com/MotorolaMobilityLLC/kernel-msm
  - There's a branch named "lollipop-5.1.1-release-falcon" in this repo which is
    the closest match to this device whose codename is 'falcon_umtsds'
    (from ro.build.product)
- There's also one from LineageOS here: https://github.com/LineageOS/android_kernel_motorola_msm8226
  - this however seems to support upto Nougat too!
  - There's also another "common device config" source from LineageOS here: https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_motorola_msm8226-common???
* TODO Setting up the android build environment
** TODO Build branch
- 
** TODO figure out the build configuration for aosp + xt1033
- refer to [[https://source.android.com/setup/build/building#initialize][this]] section
  - name typically is of the following format: <tree>_<deviceCodename>-<buildtype>
  - <buildtype> is one of:
    - user
    - userdebug
    - eng
  - from the prop=ro.product.manufacturer, manufacturer is 'manufacturer'
  - from the prop=ro.product.device, device is 'falcon_umtsds'
  - from the prop=ro.build.product, codename is 'falcon_umtsds'
  - thus, product name will be 'aosp_falcon_umtsds'?????
  - getprop doesn't seem to show the kernel version against which stockrom was built!
  - `ro.serialno` - serial number that's seen while connecting via adb/fastboot
- refer also to the 'adding a new device' doc [[https://source.android.com/setup/develop/new-device#userdebug-guidelines][here]]
* Install stock ROM
- [[https://www.mediafire.com/file/bd8shlx4jdk0rhx/Motorola_Moto_G_XT1033_Falcon_ASIA_DS_5.1_LPBS23.13-56-2_CID7_CFC.zip/file][this]] link contains the stock ROM (v5.1.1). Download and extract it. I've also
  uploaded a copy of it to my [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mp4JUUgRBhtFclAbH5tKXmD8SiK7z84I/view?usp=sharing][gdrive heREADME.orgre]].
- [[https://downloadmirror.co/29Sh/mfastboot-v2.zip%253Fpt%253D2PAv5CGjMrXGg0ggGevHoXzbVdbp6Sp7aLrXE9XMCoo%25253D][this]] link contains the mfastboot v2 exe. Download and extract it. I've also
  uploaded a copy of it to my [[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CtxJWzcZO9ZjtaYi4jEh18DMJVpqTQb7/view?usp=sharing][gdrive here]]. It is also available from Moto's
  website [[https://motorola-global-portal.custhelp.com/app/standalone/bootloader/recovery-images][here]]. (although I couldn't find the exact one for XT1033). This should
  NOT be needed as long as you have 'fastboot'!!
- Connect your device and boot it into bootloader
- Run the following commands
  #+BEGIN_SRC
  fastboot.exe flash partition gpt.bin
  fastboot.exe flash motoboot motoboot.img
  fastboot.exe flash logo logo.bin
  fastboot.exe flash boot boot.img
  fastboot.exe flash recovery recovery.img
  fastboot.exe flash dsp adspso.bin
  fastboot.exe flash oem oem.img
  fastboot.exe flash system system.img_sparsechunk.0
  fastboot.exe flash system system.img_sparsechunk.1
  fastboot.exe flash system system.img_sparsechunk.2
  fastboot.exe flash system system.img_sparsechunk.3
  fastboot.exe flash modem NON-HLOS.bin
  fastboot.exe erase modemst1 
  fastboot.exe erase modemst2 
  fastboot.exe flash fsg fsg.mbn
  fastboot.exe erase cache
  fastboot.exe erase userdata
  fastboot.exe erase customize
  fastboot.exe erase clogo
  fastboot.exe reboot
  #+END_SRC
- the above same steps can also be followed to unbrick your device too
- on forums many folks have had success by just using fastboot instead of "mfastboot"
  (which is supposed to be motorola's fastboot)
* TODO rooting Moto G
- a very nice introduction to rooting on android is [[https://jichu4n.com/posts/how-rooting-works-a-technical-explanation-of-the-android-rooting-process/][here]]

- unzip and follow instructions in its README
- superuser github repo is [[https://github.com/koush/Superuser][here]]
- UPDATE: I think we don't need this as most of the job is done via "adb"
* TODO how to extract the stock ROM and store it as a backup?
* TODO how to extract proprietary blobs?
- Refer to [[https://github.com/LineageOS/android_device_motorola_falcon][repo]] on github
- look at the script extract-files.sh
* TODO read about TWRP recovery and perform fastboot to custom recovery
** TODO building from source
- source code is [[https://github.com/omnirom/android_bootable_recovery/][here]]
- compilation guide is [[https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1943625][here]]

** TODO booting to custom recovery without flashing it
#+BEGIN_SRC
adb reboot bootloader
fastboot boot /path/to/your/custom/recovery.img
